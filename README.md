This is where you will find the documentation of our Creative Coding Course.
Please set up your own github repository to store your sketches/code and software.
Each week you will make a readme with one or more screenshots of the work you have done in class + any completed homework tasks.
You will also put your code from your homework in these foldersâ€”your homework should be your own original code.
You will tell me your github address next week in class. 

Look in each week's /code folder for snippets from the weekly workshops.
Each week's 'readme' will have links to artists.
Each week will be listed here as it gets activated.
