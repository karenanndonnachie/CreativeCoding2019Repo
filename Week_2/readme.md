<strong>Week_2 </strong>

Well we made it through the second week and we are still going steep up that learning curve with our eyes on a small plateau that will come into focus soon.

Today we covered a number of important coding elements as well as a couple of specific-to-Processing functions.
We were introduced to methods with which Processing can add, display and manipulate an image, and also how to load in a font or use the system fonts to write with Processing, more work on both of these next week.

New vocabulary to note:<br/>
  `PImage`<br/>
  `imageMode(CENTER)`<br/>
  `PFont`<br/>
  `color` eg: `color pix = photo.get (x,y);`<br/>
  `float`<br/>
  `map`<br/>
  `String`<br/>
  `createFont()`<br/>
  `loadFont()`<br/>
  `textFont()`<br/>
  `.length`  eg. `someString.length`<br/>
  `.charAt()` eg. `someString.charAt()`<br/>
  `for (int i = 0; i < limit; i++) {  }`<br/>
