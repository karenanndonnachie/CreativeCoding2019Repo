<strong>Week_2 </strong>

Well we made it through the second week and we are still going steep up that learning curve with our eyes on a small plateau that will come into focus soon.

Today we covered a number of important coding elements as well as a couple of specific-to-Processing functions.
We were introduced to methods with which Processing can add, display and manipulate an image, and also how to load in a font or use the system fonts to write with Processing, more work on both of these next week.

New vocabulary to note:
  `PImage`
  `imageMode(CENTER)`
  `PFont`
  `color` eg: `color pix = photo.get (x,y);`
  `float`
  `map`
  `String`
  `createFont()`
  `loadFont()`
  `textFont()`
  paragraph`.length`
  paragraph`.charAt()`
  `for (int i = 0; i < limit; i++) {  }`
